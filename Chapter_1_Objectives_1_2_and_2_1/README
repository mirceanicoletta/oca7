Legal identifiers

-> Identifiers must start with a letter, a currency character ($) or a connecting character such as underscore
   (_). Identifiers canot start with a digit!
-> After the first character, identifiers can contain any combination of letters, currency characters,
   connecting characters or numbers.
-> In practice, there is no limit to the number of characters an identifier can contain.
-> You can't use a Java keyword as an identifier.
-> Identifiers in java are case sensitive
